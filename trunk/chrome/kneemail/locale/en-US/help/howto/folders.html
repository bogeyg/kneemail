<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">Folders are how you organize your
prayer requests, praises and general thoughts. This topic will teach
you how to create, rename and delete folders.<br>
<br>
The following are ways to create a folder:<br>
<ul>
  <li>From the folder menu, choose New Folder.</li>
  <li>While the mouse curser is over the folder list, from context menu
(usually the right mouse button), choose New Folder.</li>
  <li>Click the toolbar button. <img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;"
 alt="Add Folder Toolbar Button" title="Add Folder Toolbar Button"
 src="images/folder_add.png"></li>
  <li>The shortcut key Shift-N.</li>
</ul>
The following are ways to rename a folder:<br>
<ul>
  <li>From the folder menu, choose Rename Folder.</li>
  <li>While the mouse curser is over the folder list, from context menu
(usually the right mouse button), choose Rename Folder.</li>
  <li>Double-click the folder name.</li>

</ul>
The following are ways to delete a folder:<br>
<ul>
  <li>From the folder menu, choose Delete Folder.</li>
  <li>While the mouse curser is over the folder list, from context menu
(usually the right mouse button), choose Delete Folder.</li>
  <li>Click the toolbar button. <img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;"
 alt="Delete Folder Toolbar Button" title="Delete Folder Toolbar Button"
 src="images/folder_delete.png"></li>
  <li>The shortcut key Shift-D.</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>There are two "special"
folders. One is for entries you mark as
Inactive and the other is for those you've deleted. These two folders
are a "safety net" in the event &nbsp;you did not intend to mark an
entry Inactive or deleted. You can not create subfolders in these two
folders.<br>
<ul>
  <li><img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;"
 alt="Delete Folder Toolbar Button" title="Delete Folder Toolbar Button"
 src="images/folder_inactive.png"> The Inactive folder is the first
folder in the folder tree.</li>
  <li><img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;"
 alt="Delete Folder Toolbar Button" title="Delete Folder Toolbar Button"
 src="images/folder_delete.png"> The Deleted folder is the second
folder in the folder tree.</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:
If you delete a folder, all of its entries are moved to the Deleted
folder. However, you can not recover the folder itself. Also, you
cannot delete the Inactive or Deleted folders.</span>
