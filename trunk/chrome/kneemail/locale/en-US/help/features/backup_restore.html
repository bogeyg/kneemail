<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">Backup and Restore are your
options to keep your&nbsp;database safe in case of a computer crash
or other computer problems. This feature only backs up your database.
Your personal preferences would not be backed up. You can reset your preferences if you need to reinstall the software.<br><br>This feature uses the popular
Zip format. This will compress your database to a size suitable for
backing up. This will also enable you to use any Zip software to get to
your database.<br><br>You can find Backup and Restore in the "Tools" menu and using this icon&nbsp;<img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="Backup and Restore" title="Backup and Restore" src="images/backup_restore.png">
in the toolbar. For a backup, you simply find the place you wish to
backup your database and give the backup a name. For a restore, you
would simply go to where you backed up the database.<br><br>In preferences, you can setup automatic backups. The auto backups will occure when you close the application.<br><br>Note:
Restoring an old database will overright any thing you have in your
current database. Please use caution when using this feature.<br>
