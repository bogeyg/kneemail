<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">The Prayer Plan feature is a way
to "schedule" when and what prayer requests you will pray for each day.
Check the "How To" section of this help system to learn how to set the
Prayer Plan settings for a given prayer request entry. You can have
more than one Prayer Plan to separate prayer requests if you wish. As
you pray for
each prayer entry, you would check the checkbox to make that entry
disapear from the Prayer Plan and have it automatically schedule the
next time it should appear.</body></html>
