        <p>The following are the ways to edit an entry's Prayer Plan settings:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Clicking this
            <img src="images/entry_prayerplan.png" alt="Prayer Plan Settings Toolbar Button" title="Prayer Plan Settings Toolbar Button" />
            toolbar button.
            <li>Choosing this action from the Entry menu.<br>
            <img src="images/edit_prayerplan_entry_menu.png" alt="Prayer Plan Settings From Menu" title="Prayer Plan Settings From Menu" style="border: solid 1px blue;" />
            <li>Choosing this action from the Entry context menu (right-click menu).<br>
            <img src="images/edit_prayerplan_entry_context.png" alt="Prayer Plan Settings From Context Menu" title="Prayer Plan Settings From Context Menu" style="border: solid 1px blue;" />
        </ul>

        <p>By default, each entry in your journal has its Prayer Plan Settings set
        to "None." This means the journal entry will never appear in any Prayer Plan
        unless you change its Prayer Plan Settings. The first thing you should do
        is choose which Prayer Plan the entry will show up in by selecting it from
        the drop-down list.</p>
        
        <center><img src="images/entry_prayerplan_none.png" alt="None" title="None" style="border: solid 1px blue;" /></center>

        <p>You can setup an entry to display in a Prayer Plan daily. You can determine
        how many days you want in between the times it shows up. And, like every
        option, you can specify when the settings will begin. The default is the
        day you setup the entry's settings.</p>
        
        <center><img src="images/entry_prayerplan_day.png" alt="Day" title="Day" style="border: solid 1px blue;" /></center>

        <p>Next, you can set any entry to display weekly. Just like daily, you
        can set how many weeks you want in between the times it shows up. You can
        also set what day(s) during the week the entry will show up.</p>
        
        <center><img src="images/entry_prayerplan_week.png" alt="Week" title="Week" style="border: solid 1px blue;" /></center>

        <p>For monthly, you have several options. The first option is to have the
        entry show up on a Prayer Plan monthly like weekly and daily. You can specify
        how many months will be in between each month and, of course, the start
        date. The other options are: "Last Day of Month", "First Day of Month",
        "First Week of Month", "Second Week of Month", "Third Week of Month" and
        "Fourth Week of Month." For each week of the month, you can specify which
        day of that week it should show up.</p>
        
        <center><img src="images/entry_prayerplan_month.png" alt="Month" title="Month" style="border: solid 1px blue;" /></center>

        <p>Next, you have the option to setup an entry to show up in years. This
        is usefull for such things as someone's birthday. Like the other options,
        you can set how many years between the times it shows up and you can set
        the starting date.</p>
        
        <center><img src="images/entry_prayerplan_year.png" alt="Year" title="Year" style="border: solid 1px blue;" /></center>

        <p>Finally, you have the option to setup an entry to show up once. This is
        usefull for such things as someone's surgery. For this setting, you just
        need to specifiy what day the entry should show up in a Prayer Plan.</p>
