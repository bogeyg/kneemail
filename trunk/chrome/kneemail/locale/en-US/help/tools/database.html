    <div class="content">
        <p>The following are the menu items for the database:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Backup/Restore
            <img src="images/backup_restore.png" alt="Backup/Restore" title="Backup/Restore" />
            <li>Database Compact
            <img src="images/database_compact.png" alt="Database Compact" title="Database Compact" />
        </ul>

        <p>Backup and Restore are your options to keep your data safe in the event
        something, like a computer crash, would happen. A backup of your database
        is stored in a ZIP file you can use to save your data to a back up CD or
        something of that nature. You can use any software that supports the ZIP
        format to extract your data. A restore of your database is what you would
        do to get back your data in case something were to happen. It will extract
        the database from the backup ZIP file and restore it to the location of
        your database.</p>
        
        <p>A database compact is what you want to do to reduce the size of your
        database. For example, if you have deleted a lot of entries, folders or
        images, the space they took up is not released. Doing a compact will free
        up that space the entries, folders and images took up.</p>
