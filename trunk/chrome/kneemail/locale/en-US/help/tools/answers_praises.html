        <img src="images/entry_answered.png" alt="Answers and Praises" title="Answers and Praises" />
        to show a list of all the answered prayer and praises in your journal. Just
        as you can with the Prayer Plan dialog, double-clicking an item on the list
        will bring up the Compose dialog if you want to edit the entry. This tool
        will help praising God for answered prayer. Below is a screenshot of the
