        <p>Choose this menu item
        <img src="images/preferences.png" alt="Preferences" title="Preferences" />
        to show the dialog you can use to set your preferences for Kneemail Desktop.</p>
        
        <p>For general preferences, you can set the sort order for the folder tree
        and set the default entry type when you compose a new entry. Below is a
        screenshot of general preferences:</p>
        
        <center><img src="images/general_preferences.png" alt="General" title="General" style="border: solid 1px blue;" /></center>

        <p>For update preferences, you can deside if you want Kneemail Desktop to
        check for updates at startup. Below is a screenshot of update preferences:</p>
        
        <center><img src="images/update_preferences.png" alt="Update Preferences" title="Update Preferences" style="border: solid 1px blue;" /></center>

        <p>The database preference is simply where you would like to store the
        database on your computer's hard drive. Below is a screenshot of the database
        preferences:</p>
        
        <center><img src="images/database_preferences.png" alt="Database Preferences" title="Database Preferences" style="border: solid 1px blue;" /></center>

        <p>Finally, the back up preferences are there for you to decide if backups
        are performed when you close out of Kneemail Desktop and you can choose
        where the automatic backups will be saved. Below is a screenshot of the
        backup preferences:</p>
