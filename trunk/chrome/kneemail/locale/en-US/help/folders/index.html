    <div class="content">
        <p>Just like in an email application, journal entries are stored in a folder
        structure. You will see you can give a folder a name, create it as a root
        folder or subfolder and can give the folder "weight."</p>

        <p>The name you give the folder will be the label given to it in the folder
        tree on the left side of the screen.</p>
        
        <p>If you check the "Create as root folder" checkbox, the folder will not
        be a subfolder to any other folders. If you have selected a folder in the
        folder tree, it will show as being the parent folder and will make the new
        folder a subfolder.</p>
        
        <p>Folder "weight" is optional. It only applies if you have set the sort
        order of the folders based on its weight. Weight works like this: the higher
        the weight value, the lower the folder shows up on the folder tree. The
        lower the number, the higher it will show on the folder tree. So, it appears
        like gravity determines the sort order.</p>
