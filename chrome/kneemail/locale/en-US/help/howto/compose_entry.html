<br>
<div style="text-align: left;">With the Compose dialog, you can write
your journal entry. The first thing you will start with is the subject.
This is used to indicate what the entry is about; much like in an email
message.<br>
<br>
Next, you can supply the entry text, or body, which will make up the
majority of the entry.<br>
<br>
For Prayer type entries, you have the option of writing an answer to
the prayer. The answer textbox only appears when the Type is set to
prayer.<br>
<br>
The Type drop-down list allows you to specify what type of journal
entry you are writing.<br>
<br>
The Status drop-down list allows you to specify the status of the
entry; whether it is Active, Answered or Inactive.<br>
<br>
Once you have saved your entry, you will have the option to set its
Prayer Plan Settings.<br>
