        <img src="images/new_folder.png" alt="New Folder" title="New Folder" style="border: solid 1px blue;" />

        <p>With this dialog, you can create a new folder. You first supply a name
        for the new folder.</p>
        
        <p>The checkbox "Create as root folder" means you can create a folder
        which is not a subfolder of another folder. In other words, root folders
        are never subfolders.</p>
        
        <p>If you have a folder already selected, you can create a new folder as
        a subfolder of the one selected. The parent folder is the folder the new
        folder will be a subfolder of.</p>
        
        <p>The folder "weight" is used if you have selected "Sort by Weight" in
        the preferences. The larger the number, the heavier its weight. The heavier
        the weight, the further down the folder tree the folder will appear.</p>
        
        <p>When you are finished, clicking the OK button will create the new folder
        whether it is a root folder or a subfolder of another.</p>
