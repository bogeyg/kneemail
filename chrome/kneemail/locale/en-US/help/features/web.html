Web resources are integrated into this software. Anywhere from
searching the Bible to pointing the integrated Web browser to your
favorite site can be done from the Web Resources screen. There is a
multi-engine search box available to you if you want to do a quick
search without leaving this application. The included engines are:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Kneemail's Web Search</li>
  <li>Bible Gateway</li>
  <li>CrossMap</li>
  <li>WikiChristian<br>
  </li>
  <li>Got Questions?</li>
  <li>SeekFind.org</li>
  <li>Answers in Genesis</li>
</ul>
Although the integrated Web browser does allow you to access any Web
Site on the Internet, it is not designed to be a replacement for your
favorite browser. However, the basics, such as forward and back
buttons, are included.<br>
