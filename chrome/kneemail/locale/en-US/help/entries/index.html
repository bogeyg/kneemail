            <li>The Text body contains the main text of any type of entry.
            <li>The Text answer contains the answer to a Prayer Request.
            <li>Scripture is any text from the Bible which would help you in your
            prayer time.
            <li>The Types are listed below.
            <li>The Statuses are listed below.<br></li>
