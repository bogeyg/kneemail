        <p>The following are the ways to launch Prayer Plans:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Clicking this
            <img src="images/prayerplan.png" alt="Prayer Plans Toolbar Button" title="Prayer Plans Toolbar Button" />
            toolbar button.
        </ul>

        <p>A Prayer Plan is simply a prayer list. It is a way to organize how and
        what you pray for each day. When you click the toolbar button, you are
        presented with the Prayer Plan dialog:</p>
        
        <center><img src="images/prayer_plan_dialog.png" alt="Prayer Plans" title="Prayer Plans" style="border: solid 1px blue;" /></center>

        <p>After you have prayed for a prayer request, you can click on the checkbox
        to have it disappear and automatically reschedule for the next time the
        prayer request should appear. After you have completed praying for a list
        of prayer requests in a plan, this dialog will automatically take you to
        the next plan in your Prayer Plans.</p>
        
        <p>To just pray for a single Prayer Plan or to edit your Prayer Plan names,
        click on the down arrow next to the toolbar button to reveal a list of
        Prayer Plans and the option to edit.</p>
        
        <center><img src="images/prayer_plan_menu.png" alt="Prayer Plan Menu" title="Prayer Plan Menu" style="border: solid 1px blue;" /></center>

        <p>You can double-click the prayer request to edit it. An example would be
        if you have an answer to the prayer request.</p>
        
        <p>To remove a prayer request from a Prayer Plan, you can double-click the
        entry and click on the Prayer Plan Settings button in the Compose dialog
        that appears.</p>
        
        <p>Below is a screenshot of the Edit Prayer Plans dialog:</p>
        
        <center><img src="images/edit_prayer_plans.png" alt="Edit Prayer Plans" title="Edit Prayer Plans" style="border: solid 1px blue;" /></center>
        
        <p>To add a new Prayer Plan, simply provide the new name and click the Add
        button. To remove a Prayer Plan, choose it from the drop-down list and click
        the Delete button. To rename a Prayer Plan, select the plan from the drop-down
        list and click Rename. Then you will be presented the following dialog:</p>
